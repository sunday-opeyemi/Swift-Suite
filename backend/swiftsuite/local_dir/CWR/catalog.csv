The solenoids lock the tabs in any position, eliminating drift back. Barb-type hose fittings provide tight, secure connections.</li><li>Motor - A powerhouse with coated wirings and a thermal overload that resists temperature and amperage build-up. 1 3/4"" stack windings and top mounting eliminated oil leakage. The motor is mounted with stainless steel nuts and bolts and is easily disassembled.</li><li>Brackets - Swivel-type brackets allow cylinders to be mounted and adjusted to any angle. Knockout pins act as shear pins it tab strikes an object.</li><li>Pump - Designed and engineered exclusively by Instatrim. The built-in bypass is factory set at 400 P.S.I. tolerance held to .00025. Amperage doesn't exceed 16 because the unit circulates oil, rather than stalling out or trying to pump additional pressure.</li><li>Motor Cover - 4 1/2"" D x 6"" W x 11""H, high impact ABS plastic cover with a built-in oil reservoir mounts easily with two screws. The filler is located in front. Our cover protects the motor from occasional wash down.</li><li>Cylinders - Impact-resistant, fiberglass-reinforced nylon cylinders eliminate expansion and resist ultra-violet rays. Two expanding type seals, plus O-ring, eliminate high and low-pressure leaks. Barbed cylinder fitting and an inserted tubular rod prevent hose blow-off and breakage. A stainless steel spring retracts the cylinder when the boat is not in motion.</li><li>Trim Tabs - 12 gauge 304 stainless steel trim tabs are available in standard and custom lengths. They are guaranteed against electrolysis, remaining strong and secure. Insta-Trim's hinges prevent most spray and can be used for transom or bottom mounting.</li><li>Hose - Designed and manufactured exclusively for Insta-Trim with nylon-reinforced webbing and protective PVC coating. Rated at 2000 lb. burst pressure, 15' of hose is supplied for your system. Entering the transom 6"" above the water line, the hoses are held securely with hose trim. Stainless steel clamps hold the hose to barb fitting at the solenoid.</li><li>Rocker Type Controls - Mounted on the dash they are easy to operate.

The face of the NavPod can easily be cut with a ""Rotozip"". It's a small handheld router style cutter that shreds the material while cutting. This eliminates any melting of the plastic material. It is also important to note that when selecting a possible Un-cut NavPod, the depth measurement stated in the chart is overall outside measurement. Actual internal clearance can be reduced by curvature from the design or molded indents for the mounting system. This can reduce the overall and needs to be considered when making a determination of actual available depth clearance.</p><p><strong>Watertight Silicone Seal</strong></p><p>Keeps rain and salt water spray off electrical connections on the back of electronics</p><p><strong>Tamperproof</strong></p><p>Special fasteners and wrench are included that provide security and convenience to leave electronics on-board</p><p><strong>Concealed Wiring</strong></p><p>No loose wires are exposed to corrosion and UV damage</p><p><strong>Clean Installation</strong></p><p>The clean look of flush mounting.

The capstan does the heavy lifting with only a small amount of effort. The maximum speed of the line retrieval depends on the rotational speed of the drum. The benefit is that the retrieval speed can be adjusted by decreasing the tension on the retrieved line, maintaining control over a very heavy load with little effort.<br>This useful device, which has been around since the early days of sailing, is still used today. Recreational fishermen, like commercial fishermen, use these for hauling crab and lobster pots and there are many other uses aboard boats. The few mechanical parts and ease of use have made this a favorite of fisherman worldwide. While chains should NEVER be wrapped around a drum, the majority of lines can be handled on a capstan.<br><br>A capstan, typically operated by an easy to use footswitch (R001459), allows the boater to control lines with ease without having additional crew members. Powerwinch has a model to fit your needs. All Powerwinch capstans come with a foot control switch that allows for hands-free operation.<br><br><font class=""large""><b>Capstan 1000</b></font><br><b>Multi-purpose rope winch for anchoring, sailing & Fishing</b><br><i>1000 pounds of pulling power!</i><br>Our largest capstan, the Capstan 1000, is a power assisted rope capstan for larger applications with 1000 pound pull power and 40 ft/minute retrieval speed. A great tool for quick retrieval lobster, prawn and crab pots. The Capstan 100 also provides power assist for limited crew sailboats and power assisted anchor retrieval.

The capstan does the heavy lifting with only a small amount of effort. The maximum speed of the line retrieval depends on the rotational speed of the drum. The benefit is that the retrieval speed can be adjusted by decreasing the tension on the retrieved line, maintaining control over a very heavy load with little effort.<br>This useful device, which has been around since the early days of sailing, is still used today. Recreational fishermen, like commercial fishermen, use these for hauling crab and lobster pots and there are many other uses aboard boats. The few mechanical parts and ease of use have made this a favorite of fisherman worldwide. While chains should NEVER be wrapped around a drum, the majority of lines can be handled on a capstan.<br><br>A capstan, typically operated by an easy to use footswitch (P7817600AJ), allows the boater to control lines with ease without having additional crew members.

The pump assembly incorporates a reversible gerotor gear pump, a two-piece gear housed in an eccentric ring. This allows for incredibly quiet, reliable and precise operation. <br><br>A hydraulic steering system consists of a hydraulic actuator and one or more steering wheel pumps, or helm pumps. As the steering wheel (helm pump) is turned in the port direction, hydraulic oil is pumped into the port hydraulic steering line. This oil is directed into the port side of the steering cylinder. As the cylinder moves to port, oil from the starboard side of the cylinder returns to the helm pump through the starboard hydraulic lines. <br><br>One end of the cylinder is fixed and the other is connected to a tiller arm, which is connected to a rudder shaft. With this connection to the tiller arm the linear movement of the cylinder to port is changed to rotary movement, which turns the rudder and steers the vessel to port. Moving the steering wheel to starboard produces the same reaction with oil being pumped out of the starboard line and returning through the port line. <br><br>If more than one helm pump is used, a return/fill line must be installed to connect the cases of all helm pumps together. <br><br>The output flow rate of the pumpset determines the speed of the steering cylinder. The PUMPHRP17-12 outputs 1.6 cu. in. of oil per second and requires a 12VDC input. <br><p><img src=""https://productimageserver.com/prop65/6pt.png"" alt=""Warning"" /><strong>WARNING:</strong> This product can expose you to chemicals which are known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.
