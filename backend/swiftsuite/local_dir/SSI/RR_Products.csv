The bits in these sets are designed to break before damaging the fastener itself. Breakage of a bit should not be considered a defect, rather it means that the fastener will require some other means of removal or an application of a suitable compound that will penetrate threads, such as Kano Kroil.|1.1|9.75|8.25|1.75|Includes a selection of the same high quality bits found in the Professional Gunsmithing Screwdriver Sets|Includes standard Phillips, hex and torx bits|1  2 inch long #2 Phillips but which is ideal for recoil pad installation|"1 hex-to-square conversion bit which allows you to use 1/4"" square drive sockets and other attachments"|1 magnetic handle is made of comfortable overmolded plastic|||T|WARNING: Cancer and Reproductive Harm - www.P65Warnings.ca.gov|CN|NO

The Basecamp Ops Navigator is equipped with an anti-snag 2 way zipper, zip baffle, hanging dry tabs, a draft collar, and a Snugfit hood. The versatile square foot design of this sleeping bag allows it to be zipped open into a square quilt or blanket. Zip the left and right hand bags together to make a large 2 person sleeping bag.

It has been made possible by careful engineering, precise manufacture, and the use of high-end polymers resulting in a light but tough knife that's easy to carry. The blade is made from 154CM stainless that is cryogenically heat treated for a lasting edge that is still easy to maintain. Each knife is honed by hand to a mirrored finish for exceptional cutting performance. It comes in either Drop Point or Tanto profile with a high flat grind. A finger groove and strategically placed jimping around the knife's edges ensure a dependable grip, and the end of the handle is pointed for use as an impact tool. For quick one-handed deployment, the EX-03 uses ambidextrous thumb studs. Once open the blade is held in place by a strong button lock. Supported by a quarter-inch pivot, oversized stop pin and set into recessed stainless steel bolster plates, the mechanism offers outstanding reliability and a solid lockup. For added security there is a manual safety that can be engaged to prevent accidental closure. The bolster plates of the EX-03 are molded right into the innovative one-piece glass reinforced PPS handle. PPS is a high tech polymer that offers exceptional toughness and thermal stability. Due to the frame's material properties the EX-03 mechanism provides a smooth dependable action in all conditions every time you open it.|0.44|6.5|2.75|1.25|4 inch Drop Point blade crafted from 154CM stainless steel|Cryogenically heat treated to 57-59 RC|High flat grind with hand honed edge|Ambidextrous thumb stud deployment with button lock and manual safety|Polymer frame with stainless steel bolster plates|||F|N/A|US|NO

Stay warmer with the Coleman OneSource Heated Sleeping Bag. The mummy-shaped bag keeps you warm in temperatures as low as 32 degrees F using 2 heating pads one at the core of the sleeping bag and one at the roomy footbox distributing heat throughout. Power your heated sleeping bag using the lithium-ion rechargeable battery, an interchangeable battery that works with all Coleman OneSource products, and eliminate the need for multiple power sources by charging your devices through the USB port. One fully charged battery gives you 2 hours on high (107 degrees F), 2.5 hours on medium (103 degrees F), 4 hours on low (96 degrees F), or 3 hours on pulse setting (low to high) of warmth. Spend more time relaxing and double the runtime by adding a second battery (sold separately) to the dual port dock that also charges your phone or other devices. A semi-sculpted hood and double batt, offset quilt construction surround your head and body to help eliminate potential cold spots. The Thermolock draft tube prevents heat loss through the zipper and Coletherm insulation provides better heat retention with less weight. The ZipPlow zipper means a snag-free opening and closing. A durable, ripstop-reinforced polyester cover ensures you get to use this sleeping bag season after season and it’s machine washable for easy cleaning after you remove the heating pads, wires, dock, and battery. When you’re ready to head home, pack the sleeping bag inside the included stuff sack.|4.98|16.5|10.25|10.25|Coleman OneSource powers your outdoor gear and devices with one interchangeable rechargeable battery system|Mummy-shape design with semi-sculpted hood helps lock in heat; rectangular footbox allows more space for your feet to move comfortably|Designed for people up to 6 ft. 2 in.|Stay warm in temperatures as low as 32  degrees  F|2 heating pads with 4 adjustable heat settings; Each pad powered by a 4800 mAh lithium-ion battery that keeps the heat going for 2 hours on high, 107 degrees F, 2.5 hours on medium ,103 degrees F, 4 hours on low 96 degrees F, or 3 hours on pulse setting low to high|Dual port battery dock holds up to 2 rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (2nd battery sold separately), doubling the runtime; also charges your phone or other devices|Machine washable (remove heating pads, wires, dock, and battery before washing)|T|Warning: This product can expose you to chemicals including Nickel compounds, which are known to the State of California to cause cancer or other reproductive harm.
